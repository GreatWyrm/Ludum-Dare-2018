# Metroidvania Idea

Each level is designed to test your skills without a certain ability

Start out with everything

You lose them and go through something.

Get a more powerful version of your ability for future levels

# Lizard Idea

Snake like controls, you are a lizard who has a tail.

Eat things to make the tail grow longer

When the tail is on you:
    It can block bullets
    It can block enemies entering
When you drop the tail:
    It can block bullets
    You can push it
    It can block enemies
    It can cross chasms

Gameplay loop is
    Eat and defend yourself long enough to grow tail segments that can be used to go through the next section
    May need to reset, sort of like sokoban

Types of obstacles:
    Lasers, cut your tail
    Bullets
    Enemies, track you, track through tail but cannot move through it.
        or maybe move more randomly

# Final ideas



Sacrifice abilites to get into areas, temporarily weaker.

You need to become a robot by sacrificng your limbs

Auction off your body parts on the black market

Lizard that drops its tail
    some sort of shmup / adventure thing, where you drop you tail to solve puzzles / block bullets and stuff.

Strip mining the landscape for resources
    Could use topographic map visuals.
